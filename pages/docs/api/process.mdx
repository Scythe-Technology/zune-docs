<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">Page is being worked on.</Callout>

A built-in library that interacts with the system process.

### Properties
1. [os](#os)
2. [arch](#arch)
3. [cwd](#cwd)
4. [args](#args)
5. [env](#env)

### Functions
1. [loadEnv](#loadenv)
2. [create](#create)
3. [run](#run)
4. [exit](#exit)
5. [onSignal](#onsignal)

## Properties
#### os
```luau
process.os: "linux" | "windows" | "macos"
```
The operating system that the process is running on.

#### arch
```luau
process.arch: "aarch64" | "x86_64" | "riscv64"
```
The cpu architecture that the process is running on.
This property can have more possible values (Usually from a custom zune build for another architecture).
It would be nice if you can consider other kinds of architectures.

#### cwd
```luau
process.cwd: string
```
The current working directory of the process.

#### args
```luau
process.args: { string }
```
The arguments passed to the process.

#### env
```luau
process.env: { [string]: string }
```
The EnvironmentMap of the process.

Order of files loaded:
- Includes `.env` file in the current working directory.
- Includes `.env.production` file in the current working directory. When `LUAU_ENV` is set to `PRODUCTION`.
- Includes `.env.development` file in the current working directory. `When LUAU_ENV` is set to `DEVELOPMENT`.
- Includes `.env.test` file in the current working directory. When `LUAU_ENV` is set to `TEST`.
- Includes `.env.local` file in the current working directory.

## Functions
#### loadEnv
```luau
process.loadEnv(): { [string]: string }
```
Same behavior as `process.env`, does not update `process.env`.
##### Returns
- `{ [string]: string }` - The EnvironmentMap of the process.

#### create
```luau
process.create(exec: string, args: { string }?, options: ProcessOptions?): (boolean, ProcessChild | string)
```
Creates a new process.
##### Parameters
- `exec: string` - The executable to run.
- `args: { string }?` - The arguments to pass to the executable.
- `options:`[`ProcessOptions`](#processoptions) - The options for the process.
##### Returns
- `boolean` - If the operation was successful.
- [`ProcessChild`](#processchild) | `string` - The process handle or an error.

#### run
```luau
process.run(exec: string, args: { string }?, options: ProcessOptions?): (boolean, ProcessRunResult | string)
```
Runs a new process.

Blocks the current process until the process has exited.

We recommend using `process.create` for non-blocking process creation.
##### Parameters
- `exec: string` - The executable to run.
- `args: { string }?` - The arguments to pass to the executable.
- `options:`[`ProcessOptions`](#processoptions) - The options for the process.
##### Returns
- `boolean` - If the operation was successful.
- [`ProcessRunResult`](#processrunresult) | `string` - The process handle or an error.

#### exit
```luau
process.exit(code: number): ()
```
Exits the current process.
##### Parameters
- `code: number` - The exit code.

#### onSignal
```luau
process.onSignal(signal: "INT", callback: () -> ()): ()
```
Registers a signal handler.

Supported signals:
- `INT` - Interrupt signal (SIGINT).

##### Parameters
- `signal: "INT"` - The signal to handle.
- `callback: () -> ()` - The callback to run when the signal is received.

## Types
#### ProcessOptions
```luau copy
export type ProcessOptions = {
	cwd: string?,
	env: { [string]: string }?,
	shell: (boolean | string)?,
}
```

#### ProcessResult
```luau copy
export type ProcessResult = {
	ok: boolean,
	code: number,
	status: "Exited" | "Stopped" | "Signal" | "Unknown",
}
```

#### ProcessRunResult
```luau copy
export type ProcessRunResult = ProcessResult & {
	stdout: string,
	stderr: string,
}
```

#### ProcessChild
```luau copy
export type ProcessChild = userdata<{
	--[[
		Waits for the process to exit. Calls system function.

		Does not yield, **blocks** process.

		@return ProcessResult
	]]
	wait: (self: ProcessChild) -> ProcessResult,
	--[[
		Kills process. Calls system function.

		Does not yield, **blocks** process.

		@return ProcessResult
	]]
	kill: (self: ProcessChild) -> ProcessResult,

	--[[
		Reads the output of the process. Stdout.

		Optional size parameter to read a specific amount of bytes.
		Nil to read all.

		@param size The size of the output to read.
		@return string
	]]
	readOut: (self: ProcessChild, size: number?) -> string,
	--[[
		Writes to the input of the process. Stdin.

		@param data The data to write to the process.
	]]
	writeIn: (self: ProcessChild, data: string) -> (),
	--[[
		Reads the error output of the process. Stderr.

		Optional size parameter to read a specific amount of bytes.
		Nil to read all.

		@param size The size of the output to read.
		@return string
	]]
	readErr: (self: ProcessChild, size: number?) -> string,
}>
